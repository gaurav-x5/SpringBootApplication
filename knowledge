REST stands for Representational State Transfer
It is just a style of how we design our resources and how we expose them using http.
Each resource can have a diff URI.

Create -> POST
Retrieve -> GET
Retrieve a specific user -> GET / users/{id}
Delete a user -> DELETE /user/{id}

Retrieve all post for a specific user - GET /users/{id}/posts
Create a post for a User - POST /users/{id}/posts
Retrieve details of a post - GET /users/{id}/posts/{post_id}

Validation, Internationalization, Exceptions to be covered further
